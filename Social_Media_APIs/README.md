# Social Media APIs

This page has some sample code and a tutorial on social media APIs.

The social media that I chose to study is -> Facebook
and the respective API is the - Graph API, used across META social media
platforms such as Whatsapp, Instagram and Facebook.

The API is a marble of moden software engineering and despite the complexity
and secrecy, it is absolutely worth studying!
